# RP2040 AimeCard Reader
Modified tinyusb CDC example to make the Raspberry Pi Pico appear as an AimeCard-Reader.

## Build instructions
Insturctions based on Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS tested under WSL2

1. Install CMake (at least version 3.13), and GCC cross compiler
```
sudo apt install cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi
```

2. Download the pico-sdk and set the `PICO_SDK_PATH` environment variable. Also set the variable in your `.bashrc` for future use.
```
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk
cd pico-sdk
git submodule update --init
export PICO_SDK_PATH=$PWD
cd ..
```

3. Clone and build this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ArduinoTM/RP2040-USB -b Aime_Reader
cd RP2040-USB
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

4. Upload the `rp2040-CardReader.uf2` that was created in your build directory.

## Note
PN532 should be HSU mode
connect PN532 Pin-SCL\RXD to pico Pin-GP4,PN532 Pin-SDA\TXD to pico Pin-GP5
The WS2818 LED should be connected to pico Pin-GP2(can be modified in /src/aime_reader.cpp)
